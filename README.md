## The "Coming Soon" site for hackPHS 2025

This repo is pretty self-explanatory, but I generated a readme so will now needlessly explain what this repo is here.

## Running

We run this page on github pages, and run the backend on pythonanywhere.com

- The backend is a really simple flask server :)
- If you want to host the backend on *not* our pythonanywhere, you'll have to change the fetch request in `index.js` from <https://hackphs.pythonanywhere.com> to your own endpoint

            <p>Free food and drinks will be provided during the hackathon, including options for people with dietary
                restrcitions. If you ever want to sleep during the hackathon, we'll have dedicated quiet sleeping areas
                for y'all to catch some Z's.
                Electrical outlets will also be available throughout the cafeteria for all your charging needs. This
                year we will not be providing a hardware lab, so make sure to bring any hardware you want to use for
                your project.

            <summary>What should I bring?</summary>
            <p>Make sure you’re ready to spend 24 hours away from home. Basically, bring a sleeping bag, extra clothes,
                a toothbrush,
                and anything else you might need to feel comfortable for a long period of time. Also, please bring
                anything you need for
                your project such as a laptop, laptop charger, and hardware.

            <summary>How do I form a team?</summary>
            <p>Teams of up to 4 people are encouraged (though not mandatory) - if you already have a team, you can form
                your team when
                registering for hackPHS, but teams won't be final until submissions. If you don't have a team before the
                event, don't
                worry! At the beginning of the event, there will be a team building workshop, which will be a great way
                to meet other
                enthusiastic people and even make new friends.
            </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Do you have a Code of Conduct?</summary>
            <p>All hackers must abide by Major League Hacking's Code of Conduct. TL;DR - all hackers should respect one
                another.
                Hackers also must abide by Princeton High School rules while on PHS grounds.

            <summary>What can I win?</summary>
            <p>hackPHS hopes to emphasize learning and collaboration more so than competition - nonetheless, there will

        <details>
            <summary>What can I learn?</summary>
            <p>While you can learn a great deal in the process of building an ambitious project in such a limited time
                frame, we also
                plan to offer many introductory workshops (around 1 hour each) during the event, for those new to
                software and/or
                hardware engineering. Specific topics will include Python, Web Development, and Circutry, among many
                others - check our
                schedule for the full list!

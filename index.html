            <summary>When and Where is hackPHS?</summary>
            <p>
                hackPHS will be held in the cafeteria of Princeton High School, located at <a
                    href="https://goo.gl/maps/kkXeczMvXWr" target="_blank">151 Moore St, Princeton, NJ</a>. Limited

            <summary>What is a hackathon?</summary>
            <p>Hackathons are where creative and enthusiastic people come together to build awesome projects in a single
                all-nighter. With awesome workshops and incredible prizes, hackers will learn about new tech, build
                innovative solutions to real-world problems, and share their creation with the community, all in one
                event. If you are looking for a competition, a place to meet fellow hackers, or even just a place to
                learn how to code, hackathons are for you. If you want to learn more, see the <a
                    href="https://mlh.io/faq/" target="_blank">MLH Hackathon FAQ</a>.

            <summary>What will be provided during the event?</summary>
            <p>Free food and drinks will be provided during the hackathon, including options for people with dietary
                restrcitions. If you ever want to sleep during the hackathon, we'll have dedicated quiet sleeping areas
                for y'all to catch some Z's.
                Electrical outlets will also be available throughout the cafeteria for all your charging needs. This
                year we will not be providing a hardware lab, so make sure to bring any hardware you want to use for
                your project.
            </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>What should I bring?</summary>
            <p>Make sure you’re ready to spend 24 hours away from home. Basically, bring a sleeping bag, extra clothes,
                a toothbrush, and anything else you might need to feel comfortable for a long period of time. Also,
                please bring anything you need for your project such as a laptop, laptop charger, and hardware.
            </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>How do I form a team?</summary>
            <p>Teams of up to 4 people are encouraged (though not mandatory) - if you already have a team, you can form
                your team when registering for hackPHS, but teams won't be final until submissions. If you don't have a
                team before the event, don't worry! At the beginning of the event, there will be a team building
                workshop, which will be a great way to meet other enthusiastic people and even make new friends.
            </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Do you have a Code of Conduct?</summary>
            <p>All hackers must abide by <a href="https://github.com/MLH/mlh-policies/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md"
                    target="_blank">Major League Hacking's Code of Conduct.</a> TL;DR - all hackers should respect one
                another. Hackers also must abide by Princeton High School rules while on PHS grounds.
            </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>What can I win?</summary>
            <p>hackPHS hopes to emphasize learning and collaboration more so than competition - nonetheless, there will
                be awesome prizes to be won for some of the best hacks made during the event! The full prize list will
                be released later - make sure to follow us on social media to find out when!
            </p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>What can I learn?</summary>
            <p>While you can learn a great deal in the process of building an ambitious project in such a limited time
                frame, we also plan to offer many introductory workshops (around 1 hour each) during the event, for
                those new to software and/or hardware engineering. Specific topics will include Python, Web Development,
                and Circutry, among many others - check our schedule for the full list!
